# Meal App

The Meal App is a web application that allows users to search for meals, view meal details, and add meals to their favorites list. It utilizes the MealDB API to fetch meal data and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the app.

## Features

- Search for a meal by name: Users can enter a meal name in the search input field and click the search button or press Enter to fetch and display the search results. The search results are updated dynamically as the user types.

- View meal details: By clicking the "Meal Details" button on a meal card in the search results, users can navigate to the meal detail page and view additional information about the selected meal, including an image, category, area, and instructions.

- Add meals to favorites: Users can add meals to their favorites list by clicking the heart icon (Add to Favorites button) on a meal card. The button text and style change to indicate whether the meal is already in the favorites list or has been successfully added. The favorites list is stored in the browser's local storage.

- View favorites: By clicking the "Favorites" button in the top right corner of the homepage, users can navigate to the favorites page and view their saved favorite meals. The favorites page displays the meal name and an image for each favorite meal.
